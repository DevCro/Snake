# Snake
Quickly made prototype of Snake game in Unity 2022.
Time spent making it: 3-4 hours for the working prototype + 1 hour fixing bugs and making improvements.

Features:

- The snake can move within the grid, and it has looped movement.
- The game restarts when the snake collides with itself.
- All food types (aka power-ups) are defined in the "FoodData" scriptable object and can be easily edited.
